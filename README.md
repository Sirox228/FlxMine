##FlxMine##

This is a simple Minesweeper clone I wrote in Haxe, using the library HaxeFlixel.

Targeting Flash requires you to target Flash Player 11.2 or higher due to the use of right mousebutton clicks in the game.

###Controls###
- Left-click tiles to reveal them
- Right-click tiles to mark them
